# minimalist-pomodoro

A minimalist pomodoro timer app. I created this because I cannot stand the endless ads,
crashes, and subscription pricing model of other pomodoro apps.

Since I'm not very knowledged at frontend development, this is created mostly through
vibe coding with Cursor and Claude 4 Sonnet.
